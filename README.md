  <h2 align="center">A client-side router for Web Components</h2>
</p>

Vaadin.Router is a small and powerful client-side router JS library. It uses the widely adopted express.js syntax for routes (`/users/:id`) to map URLs to Web Component views. All features one might expect from a modern router are supported: async route resolution, animated transitions, navigation guards, redirects, and more. It is framework-agnostic and works equally well with all Web Components regardless of how they are created (Polymer / SkateJS / Stencil / Angular / Vue / etc).

Vaadin.Router is a good fit for developers that do not want to go all-in with one framework, and prefer to have freedom in picking the components that work best for their specific needs.

```
npm install --save @vaadin/router
```

```javascript
import {Router} from '@vaadin/router';

const router = new Router(document.getElementById('outlet'));
router.setRoutes([
  {path: '/', component: 'x-home-view'},
  {path: '/users', component: 'x-user-list'}
]);
```
