Passes all route parameters to the redirect target.\nThe target route should also be defined.\nSee also **Redirects** section in [Live Examples](#/classes/Vaadin.Router/demos/demo/index.html).\n\n* `bundle` – `.js` or `.mjs` bundle to load before resolving the route. Each bundle is only loaded once.\nThe property is ignored when either an `action` returns the result or `redirect` property is present.\nAny error, e.g. 404 while loading bundle will cause route resolution to throw.\nSee also **Lazy Loading** section in [Live Examples](#/classes/Vaadin.Router/demos/demo/index.html).\n\n* `children` – an array of nested routes or a function that provides this\narray at the render time. The function can be synchronous or asynchronous:\nin the latter case the render is delayed until the returned promise is\nresolved. The `children` function is executed every time when this route is\nbeing rendered. This allows for dynamic route structures (e.g. backend-defined),\nbut it might have a performance impact as well. In order to avoid calling\nthe fuction on consequent renders, you can override the `children` property\nof the route object and save the calculated array there\n(via `this.children = [ route1, route2, ...];`).\nParent routes are fully resolved before resolving the children. Children\n'path' values are relative to the parent ones.\n\n* `component` – the tag name of the Web Component to resolve the route to.\nThe property is ignored when either an `action` returns the result or `redirect` property is present.\nIf route contains the `component` property (or an action that return a component)\nand its child route also contains the `component` property, child route's component\nwill be rendered as a light dom child of a parent component.\n\nFor any route function (`action`, `children`) defined, the corresponding `route` object is available inside the callback\nthrough the `this` reference. If you need to access it, make sure you define the callback as a non-arrow function\nbecause arrow functions do not have their own `this` reference.\n\n`context` object that is passed to `action` function holds the following properties:\n* `context.pathname` – string with the pathname being resolved\n\n* `context.params` – object with route parameters\n\n* `context.route` – object that holds the route that is currently being rendered.\n\n* `context.next()` – function for asynchronously getting the next route contents from the resolution chain (if any)\n\n* `context.redirect(path)` – function that creates a redirect data for the path specified.\n\n* `context.component(component)` – function that creates a new HTMLElement with current context",

It exists only for documentation purposes, i.e.\nyou _do not need_ to extend it in your code&mdash;defining a method with a\nmatching name is enough (this class does not exist at the run time).\n\nIf any of the methods described below are defined in a view Web Component,\n`Vaadin.Router` calls them at the corresponding points of the view\nlifecycle. Each method can either be synchronous or asynchronous (i.e. return\na Promise). In the latter case `Vaadin.Router` waits until the promise is\nresolved and continues the navigation after that.\n\nCheck the [documentation on the Vaadin.Router class](#/classes/Vaadin.Router)\nto learn more.\n\nLifecycle callbacks are executed after the new path is resolved and after all\n`action` callbacks of the routes in the new path are executed.\n\nExample:\n\nFor the following routes definition,\n```\n// router and action declarations are omitted for brevity\nrouter.setRoutes([\n {path: '/a', action: actionA, children: [\n   {path: '/b', action: actionB, component: 'component-b'},\n   {path: '/c', action: actionC, component: 'component-c'}\n ]}\n]);\n```\nif the router first navigates to `/a/b` path and there was no view rendered\nbefore, the following events happen:\n* actionA\n* actionB\n* onBeforeEnterB (if defined in component-b)\n* outlet contents updated with component-b\n* onAfterEnterB (if defined in component-b)\n\nthen, if the router navigates to `/a/c`, the following events take place:\n* actionA\n* actionC\n* onBeforeLeaveB  (if defined in component-b)\n* onBeforeEnterC (if defined in component-c)\n* onAfterLeaveB  (if defined in component-b)\n* outlet contents updated with component-c\n* onAfterEnterC (if defined in component-c)\n\nIf a `Promise` is returned by any of the callbacks, it is resolved before proceeding further.\nAny of the `onBefore...` callbacks have a possibility to cancel the navigation and fall back\nto the previous navigation result (if there is no result and this is the first resolution, an exception is thrown).\n`onAfter...` callbacks are considered as non-cancellable, and their return value is ignored.\n\nOther examples can be found in the\n[live demos](#/classes/Vaadin.Router/demos/demo/index.html) and tests.",
