Passes all route parameters to the redirect target.\nThe target route should also be defined.\nSee also **Redirects** section in [Live Examples](#/classes/Vaadin.Router/demos/demo/index.html).\n\n* `bundle` – `.js` or `.mjs` bundle to load before resolving the route. Each bundle is only loaded once.\nThe property is ignored when either an `action` returns the result or `redirect` property is present.\nAny error, e.g. 404 while loading bundle will cause route resolution to throw.\nSee also **Lazy Loading** section in [Live Examples](#/classes/Vaadin.Router/demos/demo/index.html).\n\n* `component` – the tag name of the Web Component to resolve the route to.\nThe property is ignored when either an `action` returns the result or `redirect` property is present.\n\n* `children` – nested routes. Parent routes' properties are executed before resolving the children.\nChildren 'path' values are relative to the parent ones.\n\n* `inactivate` – after each resolution, router marks each route used in the resolution as an active route:\nif a hierarchy of '/a', '/b' (child of '/a'), '/c' (child of '/b') routes was defined, and user visits '/a/b/c' path,\nrouter will track ['/a', '/b', '/c'] routes as active ones, remembering their order also.\nDuring the next resolution, router compares new routes used in the resolution and,\nat the moment when they start to differ from the active ones, router calls 'inactivate' method on each route that is different:\nif, for previous example, user visits '/a/d' path and it's a valid path, routes '/c' and '/b' will be inactivated.\nInactivation always happens from the last active element to the first that is different from the new route,\nif the method is not defined for any route, the route is skipped.\nEach `inactivate` call gets a `context` parameter, described above.\nIn this case, context parameter contains an additional `inactivatedRoute` property,\nthat holds an information on the currently inactivated route.\nIf `inactivate` method returns `false`, inactivation and new path resolution is cancelled,\nrouter restores the state before new resolution.\nOtherwise router updates the active routes and waits for the next resolution to happen.\n\nNote: `inactivate` is considered to be an internal router feature, for the examples, refer to the router tests.",
